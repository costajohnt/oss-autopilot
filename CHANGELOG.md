# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Proactive PR health check notification on session start — reads cached state to show "2 of 15 PRs need attention" without any network calls; configurable via `showHealthCheck` setting
- "Why OSS Autopilot?" competitive comparison section in README

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- Stale `needs_response` status when contributor has already pushed changes addressing maintainer feedback
  - GitHub's `reviewDecision` stays `changes_requested` until maintainer re-approves, causing false positives
  - Now compares latest commit timestamp against last maintainer comment — if the commit is newer, shows `changes_addressed` instead of `needs_response`
  - New `changes_addressed` status shown in daily digest, dashboard, and JSON output
  - Not counted in `totalNeedingAttention` (not actionable by contributor)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-08

### Removed

- Deleted `src/index.ts` — 1,172 lines of dead code from the pre-Commander monolith
- Removed `dotenv` dependency — token detection uses `gh auth token` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN`, not `.env` files

### Fixed

- `package.json` `main` field pointed to non-existent `dist/index.js`, now points to `dist/cli.js`
- State file now written with `0600` permissions (owner-only read/write) for security
- Events array capped at 1,000 entries to prevent unbounded state file growth
- Replaced `any` types in `issue-discovery.ts` with proper `GitHubSearchItem` interface

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Pre-commit hooks enforcing workflow rules from CLAUDE.md:
  - **Version sync check** — blocks commits when `package.json`, `plugin.json`, and README badge versions don't match
  - **No AI attribution** — blocks commits containing "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar attribution
  - **No commits on main** — blocks direct commits to `main`/`master` branch
  - **Conventional commit format** — blocks messages without `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` etc. prefix

### Fixed

- README version badge stuck at 0.4.1 while actual version was 0.6.1
- CLAUDE.md versioning checklist missing README badge as a required update location

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- SessionStart hook for automatic stale bundle rebuild after plugin updates
- Daily update notification — shows when a newer version is available on GitHub
- Version display in `/oss` summary output (e.g., "v0.6.1")

### Fixed

- CLI bundle not rebuilt after `/plugin update` — Step 0.5 only checked file existence, not staleness
- CLI VERSION constant hardcoded at 0.1.0 — now reads from package.json at runtime

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Pre-commit code review step (Step 5.5) in `/oss` workflow — comprehensive quality gate before committing
- New `pre-commit-reviewer` agent for standalone code review
- Parallel dispatch of PR review toolkit agents (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, code-simplifier, pr-test-analyzer) for thorough analysis
- Target repository convention checking (CONTRIBUTING.md, lint configs, test patterns)
- Fix-review-commit loop: address findings, re-review until clean, then commit (with optional manual diff review)
- Conditional dispatch of type-design-analyzer and comment-analyzer for relevant changes
- Fallback to local pre-commit-reviewer agent when PR review toolkit is unavailable

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Track closed PRs from GitHub — queries `is:pr is:closed is:unmerged` to populate `closedWithoutMergeCount` in repo scores
- Recently closed PRs section in daily digest and dashboard — surfaces PRs closed without merge in the last 7 days
- `fetchUserClosedPRCounts()` and `fetchRecentlyClosedPRs()` methods in PRMonitor
- `ClosedPR` type and `recentlyClosedPRs` field in `DailyDigest`
- `recently_closed` actionable issue type for structured output

### Fixed

- Merge rate was always 100% because `closedWithoutMergeCount` was never populated from GitHub
- Closed PRs were invisible — a PR closed by a maintainer would silently vanish from the dashboard

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- Deduplicate CI check runs by name to prevent superseded failures from incorrectly flagging PRs
  - GitHub's `checks.listForRef` returns all historical runs including re-runs
  - Now keeps only the most recent run per unique check name
  - Fixes false "CI Failing" status when a check is re-run and passes

### Added

- Tests for CI status deduplication logic in `pr-monitor.test.ts`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-02-07

### Added

- Curated issue list integration and post-PR flow continuity
- CHANGELOG.md with reconstructed version history
- Version badge and new README sections: Updating, Troubleshooting, FAQ
- Release process documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md

### Changed

- Synced version across `plugin.json` and `package.json` (both now `0.4.0`)
- README overhaul with improved structure and new user-facing sections
